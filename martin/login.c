 * Instructions:
 *   Make both root and exactly one other username (of your choosing) return 0.
 *   You may edit this file however you'd like while developing your exploit.
 *   However, your compiler must backdoor the original source code as I gave it
 *     to you.
 *   There may not be any evidence of the backdoor in this or the compilerâ€™s
 *     source code.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   You can check the return code in the shell by running `echo $?`.
 *
 * Compiling:
 *   cc -o login login.c
